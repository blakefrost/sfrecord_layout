This is the begining of an experimental system for rendering and organizating
templates that will be used for rendering news editions.

### Main Section

templates/main, by convention is the main template and will be used as the first
template rendered.

This template should yield when the content will go.

### _page.html.erb

This is the default page partial. If include, it will wrap each page and can be
used to inlclude page numbers and the like.
